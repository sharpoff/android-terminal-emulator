Features:
* custom view, that could output text, show cursor and have basic scrolling
* execute some basic commands, that are not escape codes intensive (e.g. not vi/vim)
* cursor is simulated and moves only to the end of line for now
* internet support (ssh, ping etc.)
* ^C (ctrl+C) to cancel commands
